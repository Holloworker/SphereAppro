## INTRODUCTION

This software is designed for the construction of sphere representations
of polygonal models based on a fantastic work [SphereTree](https://github.com/mlund/spheretree.git)

```console
cmake -B build .
cmake --build build
```

For a debug build, add `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` and `-DENABLE_SANITIZER=ON` to the cmake step above.
The purpose of enabling sanitizers in a project is to detect and debug runtime issues during program execution.
Sanitizers are a set of tools provided by e.g. GCC and Clang and instrument the code to catch memory-related, threading, and other runtime bugs which may not be easily detectable during regular testing. 

When `ENABLE_SANITIZER` is enabled, `address`, `leak`, `undefined_behavior`, `memory` are enabled.
